# ClientMaster
This application was developed on Android Studio using Java. It is basically a dictionary of all the current clients of the candy company Swikar. When three letters or more
are typed on the search bar, it autocompletes the search and when one of the options for auto completion is tapped, the info for that specific client appears. There are
also options to add new clients, delete existing clients and edit existing clients. I have not yet added a conection to a data base so the information added or modified in
the dictionary is only local in that particular device.

This app could be merged into one with the other app I developed for Swikar, which can be found here: https://github.com/jmossorio99/swikar_inventory

In the future, the idea is to create just one app and add more functionalities.
